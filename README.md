A fork of Bear-Dictionary's fork of Flutter Gradients. The null-safe changes he added are merged into the main branch and files are moved around to allow this repository to be used as a flutter dependancy. Even after merging in the null-safe changes, Flutter was still seeing it as a legacy package so I redid the pubspec.yaml file to the current template as well as all other non-library files.

Hopefully Jonathan Monga will get the original up to null saftey and this fork will no longer be necessary.
